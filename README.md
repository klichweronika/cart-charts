# Cart charts

Simple app written in React, TypeScript. To build based UI components I used SCSS. It displays the list of the carts in the table. We can add and delete chosen carts. When clicking on the cart from the table, information about price and discount occurred on the chart. To optimise app performance I decided not to install unnecessary libraries and keep the app as simple as possible.

## Build and run the project

1. yarn install
2. yarn start
